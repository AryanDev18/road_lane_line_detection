# Road Lane Line Detection

## Project Overview

This project is aimed at detecting road lane lines using computer vision techniques in Python. It is a critical component for self-driving cars and can help in public safety by ensuring vehicles stay in their lanes.

## Technologies

- Deep Computer Vision
- Python
- OpenCV

## Objectives

1. Detect white markings in the lane.
2. Localize the road and determine the relative position between vehicle and road.
3. Handle both painted and unpainted roads, curved and straight roads in different weather conditions.
